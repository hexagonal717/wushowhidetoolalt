# WUShowHideToolAlt

## Why I Created This Project

### Background:
Maintaining a Windows system often involves repetitive tasks that can be tedious and time-consuming. I noticed that Windows annoyingly installs outdated GPU drivers through Windows Update, which has negatively impacted system performance and stability.

### The Problem:
**Windows Update** has a habit of installing ***older or unwanted GPU drivers***, which can sometimes lead to compatibility issues, crashes, or performance degradation.

## Overview

This script performs a series of maintenance tasks on a Windows system, including cleaning up temporary files, disabling Delivery Optimization, and hiding old GPU drivers from Windows Update. The script performs the following actions:

1. **Administrative Privileges Check**: Ensures the script is running with administrative privileges. If not, it restarts itself with elevated permissions.
2. **Disk Cleanup**: Configures and runs the Disk Cleanup tool (`cleanmgr`) with specific cleanup options.
3. **Delivery Optimization Service**: Disables the Delivery Optimization service to prevent unnecessary background data transfer.
4. **SoftwareDistribution Folder Cleanup**: Takes full ownership, cleans up the SoftwareDistribution folder, and restores default ownership.
5. **GPU Driver Hiding**: Installs the PSWindowsUpdate module (if not already installed) and hides old GPU drivers from Windows Update.
6. **Scheduled Task Creation**: Saves the script to C: drive and schedules it to run at logon to hide old GPU drivers.

## Script Components

### 1. Administrative Privileges Check
The script first checks if it's running as an administrator. If not, it attempts to restart with elevated privileges.

### 2. Disk Cleanup
The script sets specific cleanup options and runs `cleanmgr` to perform disk cleanup. After cleanup, it removes the state flags from the registry.

### 3. Delivery Optimization Service
The script disables the Delivery Optimization service by setting its startup type to disabled.

### 4. SoftwareDistribution Folder Cleanup
The script stops Windows Update services, takes ownership of the `SoftwareDistribution` folder, deletes its contents with a retry mechanism, and restores the folderâ€™s ownership to default settings.

### 5. GPU Driver Hiding
The script installs and uses the `PSWindowsUpdate` module to hide old GPU drivers from Windows Update.

### 6. Scheduled Task Creation
A scheduled task is created to run a PowerShell script at logon that hides old GPU drivers from Windows Update.

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell
- Administrative privileges
- `PSWindowsUpdate` PowerShell module (installed by the script if not present)

## How to Use

1. **Download Instructions for the Script:**
    - If you want to download the entire repository, you can do so by cloning it using Git or by downloading it as a ZIP file.
    - **To download as a ZIP file:**
        - On the main repository page, click the **Code** button (usually green) and select **Download ZIP**.
        - Extract the ZIP file to access the `WUShowHideToolAlt.ps1` script.
    - **To clone using Git:**
        - Open Git Bash or a terminal.
        - Run the following command:
          ```bash
          git clone https://github.com/hexagonal717/wushowhidetoolalt
          ```
        - This will clone the entire repository to your local machine, and you can access the `WUShowHideToolAlt.ps1` script.

2. **Ensure an Internet Connection:**
    - The script depends on Windows Update to retrieve the old drivers from the server so that we can block the old drivers.

3. **Pause Windows Update:**
    - Go to Settings > Windows Update > Pause (pause for 1 week).

4. **Open Windows Terminal or CMD.**

5. **Run the Script:**
    - Copy and paste the following code:
      ```bash
      powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\Script\WUShowHideToolAlt.ps1"
      ```
    - Replace `C:\Path\To\Your\Script\WUShowHideToolAlt.ps1` with the actual path to the script on your machine, and be sure to enclose the path in double quotes (`"`).

6. **Install `PSWindowsUpdate` Module:**
    - If prompted, type `Y` and press enter.

7. **Let the Script Run:**
    - The script will perform its tasks automatically and create a scheduled task for future automatic executions.
    - The script will take around 3 minutes to finish executing. Be patient.

8. **Important! Run DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller):**
    - Follow the instructions in the video below:
      `(Do the DDU safe mode method.)`
        - [How to download and use DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)](https://youtu.be/1XlwirtWs_c?si=aw5g3N4NUi8TGURM&t=142)

9. **Download and Install the Appropriate GPU Driver After Reboot:**
    - Download the latest GPU driver from the respective links:
        - **AMD**: [AMD Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html)
            - ***Also download Chipset drivers along with GPU drivers for AMD.***
        - **Nvidia**: [Nvidia Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)
        - **Intel**: [Intel Drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

10. **Enable / Resume Windows Update back in Settings**

11. **Verify the Task and Script:**
    - If everything is done correctly, there will be a `HideOldGPUDriversFromWU.ps1` file in the ***root of your C: Drive*** and a task named `HideOldGPUDriversFromWU` in ***Task Scheduler***.

    ### `HideOldGPUDriversFromWU.ps1` file in C: Drive:

    ### `HideOldGPUDriversFromWU` task in Task Scheduler:
    ![WUShowHideToolAlt Banner](./guide-assets/task-scheduler.png)

    - ### Caution:
        - Do not move the `HideOldGPUDriversFromWU.ps1` file placed in the root of C: Drive. It is essential for the Task Scheduler for the automation of the script.
